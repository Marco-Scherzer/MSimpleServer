# MSimpleServer
My simple mini server architecture. Development started in early 2025 (3 weeks) and has currently reached four weeks of progress (status as of October 31, 2025). This early version focuses on HTTP and HTTPS handler implementations and currently supports only simple HttpServer and HttpsServer features with a focus on security through minimalism.
