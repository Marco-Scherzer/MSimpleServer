# MSimpleServer

This Project contains my simple mini server architecture ( com.marcoscherzer.msimpleserver ).
Development started in early 2025 (3 weeks) and has currently reached four weeks of progress ( status as of October 31, 2025 ). 
This early version focuses on HTTP and HTTPS handler implementations and currently supports only simple 
HttpServer and HttpsServer features with a focus on security through minimalism.
MSimpleServer is a single-developer project implemented entirely in Java. External dependencies: 0.
It currently runs on both desktop and Android environments via console interface.

While the current focus is on Android GUI integration ( com.marcoscherzer.mminigui ), 
the core package ( com.marcoscherzer.msimpleserver ) remains platform-independent and compatible with desktop environments.

Common About-Me:
Im an alrounder not a specialist.
Not for networking, nor for http things or Android.
I recently transitioned from multiplatform development to Android-specific projects.
My current work is intended solely for my own personal use.
