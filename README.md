# MSimpleServer
com.marcoscherzer.msimpleserver
My simple mini server architecture. Development started in early 2025 (3 weeks) and has currently reached four weeks of progress
(status as of October 31, 2025). This early version focuses on HTTP and HTTPS handler implementations and currently supports only 
simple HttpServer and HttpsServer features with a focus on security through minimalism.
MSimpleServer is pure Java. External dependencies: 0. It runs currently on Desktop and Android environments (console).


While the current focus is on Android GUI integration ( com.marcoscherzer.mminigui ), 
the core package ( com.marcoscherzer.msimpleserver ) remains platform-independent and compatible with desktop environments.
