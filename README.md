# This is the Page of MSimpleServer and my Simple Mini Server Architecture.

#### Development started in early 2025 and had reached 4 weeks of progress when 
#### it started to work for my own simple scenario purposes.
#### Since October 31, 2025, I decided to additionally develop my project on GitHub.


#### This early version focuses on HTTP and HTTPS handler implementations and currently supports only simple HttpServer and HttpsServer features with a focus on security through minimalism.

#### MSimpleServer is a single-developer project implemented entirely in Java. External dependencies: 0.

#### It currently runs on both desktop and Android environments via console interface.

#### While the current focus is on Android GUI integration ( com.marcoscherzer.mminigui ), the core package ( com.marcoscherzer.msimpleserver ) remains platform-independent and compatible with desktop environments.

Important: This private repository is archived at irregular intervals with timestamps stored on an
independent archiving site.
For that reason, it may temporarily be set a short time to public during the archiving process.
It is strictly forbidden to interact with this repository in any way.

#### Common About-Me:

Im an oldschool alrounder not a specialist.
Not for networking, nor for http things or Android.
I recently transitioned from multiplatform development to Android-specific projects.
My current work is intended solely for internal use within my own self‑employment, which means for
myself and my projects.

# Declaration to Avoid Scamming, Theft of Intellectual Property, and Deception by Fraudsters

To prevent scamming, theft of intellectual property, and the deception of persons by fraudulent
actions, I hereby make the following statement once and for all, clearly and explicitly:

**Please note:** I never grant any permissions, not in the past, not now, and not in the future.

---

## 1. Abuse and Phishing

To prevent abuse or phishing, there are no other websites, email addresses, or communication
channels connected to the software on this page except the listed official email address.

If you find the code or binaries anywhere other than at  
[https://github.com/Marco-Scherzer](https://github.com/Marco-Scherzer),  
it is abuse, a scam, and theft of law‑protected intellectual property.

In such a case, please inform GitHub and email me.

---

## 2. False Claims of Involvement or Permission

Any false claim by any person to be in any way involved in my projects, or to have received any
permission from me – whether for usage, reproduction, replication, especially of APIs,
functionality, modularity, architecture, or for public display – is untrue and constitutes a *
*serious criminal offense**.

This includes in particular:

- Scamming and fraudulent deception
- Theft of intellectual property
- Always implicit defamation of the true author of a work and his business, since the truth about
  the origin of a work is reputation‑critical

I explicitly declare that I **never grant any licenses of any kind for an open source work and
especially not for its code – not in the past, not now, and not in the future.**
